Qapla reference monitor (QRM)
=============================
Reference: https://people.mpi-sws.org/~aasthakm/files/qapla.pdf
This code provides a standalone implementation of QRM. An example
script is provided, which can be used to generate re-written SQL
queries for mysql DB. The re-written queries can be executed
manually on the DB backend.

Steps to use:
(1) Setup your database in mysql.
(2) Create an administrative user (e.g. qapla).
(3) Configure DB_NAME and DB_ADMIN in config.h to the name of your
database and user respectively.
(4) Define your policies (see below)
(5) Generate re-written queries using refmon script
(6) Execute generated queries on database

QRM can be integrated with a database adapter, to provide policy
enforcement for an application at runtime.

Dependencies
============
QRM relies on a mysql parser, which was taken from mysql workbench.
The parser requires antlr3 and boost libraries. It has been tested with
the following versions of the libraries.
antlr3.4 - http://www.antlr3.org/download/C/libantlr3c-3.4.tar.gz
boost-1.58

Qapla has been tested on mysql 5.7.11, however, it is largely
database-independent.
